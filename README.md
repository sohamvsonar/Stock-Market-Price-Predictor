# Expense Tracker Application

## 1. Overview

The Expense Tracker App is a mobile application designed to help users manage their expenses, track spending across different categories, and maintain a record of financial transactions. It provides an intuitive interface for creating and managing groups, decks, and flashcards, allowing users to organize their expenses efficiently. The expense tracker application which also has a currency converter feature where we can get the live rate of any currency, we can make groups of specific categories or trips where we can add the expense incurred in these groups. It saves the data using a sqflite database model, where all the data gets stored locally. We can also add friends in the friends tab, and it displays the amount owed to a friend. The live rates of the currency gets fetched from a API from the web.

My application has the following high-level features:

1. There are at least 3 separate screens/pages in my application, each of which implemented as a separate widget. One of these pages is set to be the default "home" page that is displayed when the application is first launched. Navigation between pages are implemented using the standard Flutter mechanisms (e.g., `Navigator`, `TabBar`, `BottomNavigationBar`, etc.).
2. All of the pages in my application are backed by a stateful widget, which in turn is backed by a custom model class. This model class encapsulates the data that is displayed/manipulated on the page. I have choose these mechanisms (e.g., `setState`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Provider`, etc.) to update the UI on model object updates.
3. My app persists some user-updateable data across application launches in some way. Where I have used sqflite as a mechanism to do so, which stores all of the data in file locally.
4. My app also access some data from an external source (e.g., a RESTful API) and displays it in the app.
